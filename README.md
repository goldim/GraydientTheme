# About the «GraydientTheme»

The «GraydientTheme» mainly relies on CSS techniques in order to create the appearances of widgets. This makes it rather lightweight and the rendering of GUI elements shows almost no delays.

In the current version of «Graydient» a lot of items have changed compared to the earlier version of 2011. Some people might even say that it's not the same theme anymore. Nevertheless, I hope a few people like it and consider using it in one of their applications.
